My gig active issue

Hello Customer Support Specialist

I made a gig 1 day ago. I used the custoemr support feature to check the status 
of my gig. I get this message when I want to check the status of my gig 
"Looks like your Gig is active but needs further review from our side 
to appear in search results. Please contact us so we can check your 
Gig and help you out." I love Fiverr marketplace and support team. Please solve
 my problem and active my gig.
--------------------------------------------------------
I made this gig last day. Today when I was checking my Gig's impression
 and click then I saw this message "Looks like your Gig is active but needs 
further review from our side to appear in search results. Please contact us 
so we can check your Gig and help you out". I created this Gig for giving 
sevice "WordPress Full Website".


Today I have been changed Gig image. I have been changed the Gig image because 
I am getting an impression but not getting clicks. 
 After changing Gig image I have saw my Gig is under review. 
Before changing Gig iamge there was no issue. 

Loving Fiverr I have been created Fiverr account. Please active my Gig.

Kind regards
